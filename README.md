## Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)

### [CMU 11-785 HW1P1](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S23/index.html)
Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron with numpy. The assignment is very straight forward, just implement as specified in PDF. It covers forward and backward propagation, some activation functions, SGD and batch normalization.

**Key Topics:**
- Basic neural network architecture
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Gradient descent optimization
- Activation functions
- Batch Normalization

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆


### [CMU 11-785 HW1P2](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S23/index.html)
Implementation of MLP for speech recognition. The assignment teaches how to deal with data and optionally fine-tune the hyperparameters.

**Key Topics:**
- Basic pytorch
- Data handling
- Fine-Tune Hyperparameters

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

### [MIT 6.S191 Lab 1 Part 2](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning)
Implementation of a LSTM for generating music sequences. The lab explores how to model sequential data and a LSTM implementation with pytorch LSTM, but in a guided way since is the second lab from MIT 6.S191.

**Key Topics:**
- LSTM implementation
- Sequence modeling
- Character-level generation

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆

## Transformers


### [Sentiment Analysis with LLM Fine-tuning](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch)
Self-directed assignment based on "Building LLMs from Scratch" book. Adapted the book's code to fine-tune a GPT2-style model for financial sentiment analysis using the [Twitter Financial News Sentiment dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zeroshot/twitter-financial-news-sentiment).

**Key Topics:**
- Transformer architecture
- Transfer learning
- Fine-tuning techniques
- Sentiment classification

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆

## Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

### [Yandex Data School Homework03 Part 1](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/deep_vision_and_graphics/blob/fall24/homework03/homework-part1-vae.ipynb)
Implementation of an Autoencoder and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the CelebA dataset. We build AE and VAE architectures, VAE loss function and train them. Good introduction but I prefer the MIT assignment below, which is similar.

**Key Topics:**
